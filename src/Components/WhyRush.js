                <p>Tau Kappa Epsilon was founded on January 10th, 1899, on the two most basic principles that have guided our Fraternity for the last 120 years:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We are the only Fraternity to have never had an exclusionary clause—meaning that even in 1899, only your character is what mattered—not race, religion, culture or socio-economic status.</li>
                    <li>Our brotherhood and our uniqueness stem from the idea that what makes TKE strong are the individuals that make up our chapters, and alumni associations across the country. We do not ask you to change; individualism is KEY. There is no “ideal TKE man” because that is YOU.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In today's world, coming of age and college can be a confusing time for young men. Everyone is connected via social media, but we want more. We want to be able to learn about ourselves, each other, and life with diverse sets of people who can guide us along the way. Tau Kappa Epsilon is that opportunity whether you are joining an existing chapter or starting a new one. Leadership, networking, creating culture, and pursuing excellence are all key ideals in Tau Kappa Epsilon that have allowed us to lead the Fraternity world since our inception.</p>
                <p>We need you to help us to continue that path forward, growing stronger together than we ever could imagine alone.</p>
